OVERVIEW:
FastQC → Trimmomatic/Sickle →  Contamination Removal →  FastQC (optional)

Contaminant Removal Options:
RemoveRNA (prokaryote, meta-samples) – bbduk with SortMeRNA database
RemoveHost (meta-samples, etc)
RemoveSpike (all) - BBMap

Outputs: *_1.final.fa, *_2.final.fa, *_u.final.fa, *_12.final.fa, *stats.txt, *finalstats.txt

DIRECTIONS:
After putting your raw reads (in *gz format) in the Input folder above, please run the scripts in alphabetical order (i.e. A_Run*, then B_Run*, etc.). 
If you wish to skip a decontamination step, please use the *_skip.sh script in it's place (i.e. instead of D_Run*, use D_skip.sh).

Sometimes our file names are variable, with some using *R1* or *_1* to designate the read 1, and similar for read 2.  This is a consideration
when running this workflow, but it is easy to adjust.  In the C_RunTrimmomaticandSickle.sh file, there are two points where you will need to
adjust the code to account for *R1* format - they are labeled with the changes needed.  There are only two points, and they are both at the 
top of the script.

SCRIPT SPECIFIC NOTES:

C_RunTrimmomaticandSickle.sh:
adapters.fa holds the adapters used for trimmomatic.  Please review to make sure they match the adapters you used for your sequencing.
Also, please feel free to adjust the trimmomatic settings to match any oddities in your initial fastqc reporting.

D_RunRemoveSpike.sh:
The spike sequences are in the file phix_adapters.fa.gz in the ../Reference directory.  Feel free to add other files here to remove any
known contaminants, and simply replace the file name in this script to remove them.

E_RunRemoveHost.sh:
The host is defaulted to human, but mouse is also supported.  Please see database download instructions in the set up to set these up.

F_RunRemoveRNA.sh:
SortMeRNA Databases:
The difference between the databases is the % ID for clustering the sequences for each kingdom + rRNA component.
Specifically,

smr_v4.3_default_db.fasta -> bac-16S 90%, 5S & 5.8S seeds, rest 95% (benchmark accuracy: 99.899%)
smr_v4.3_sensitive_db.fasta -> all 97% (benchmark accuracy: 99.907%)
smr_v4.3_sensitive_db_rfam_seeds.fasta -> all 97%, except RFAM database which includes the full seed database sequences

H_CopyResults.sh:
After you run this script, you will end up with a directory called "final_QC_output".  This holds a copy of your final cleaned data.  
To save on space, you can remove all other folders in this directory once you are satisfied with the final files.  These files are in
various formats to allow for downstream use in paired, single, and interleaved formats.

If you would like to re-run fastqc on the final output, you can do so with:
cd final_QC_output/
for f in *fq; do
    fastqc $f;
done
