The QC script will do the following: 

1) Make script to symlink all assemblies here
2) Make script to run BUSCO on all
3) Make script to run quast on all
4) Make script to combine into a tables

The main output (along with folders for quast and busco, if you want to dive deeper into the results) are the following:
a) BUSCO.table - a table of only the busco results
b) quast.table - a table of only the quast results
c) QC.table - a tab deliminated table of all the results combined

To read the table it is best to use:
less -S QC.table 

This command will stop line wrapping, allowing you to scroll through the table.
